## SplitFlap 2026
A SplitFlap control implemented in JavaFX, based on Canvas.
The control uses 6 nodes on the scenegraph and it fires a FlipEvent.FLIP_STARTED when
the flipping starts and a FlipEvent.FLIP_FINISHED when the target character is reached.
You can choose between different CharacterSets e.g. ALPHA, ALPHA_NUMERIC etc. and there
4 different fonts available to choose from.
One can set the flip time from 10-5000 ms which is the time for one flap to flip down.
You can also set the background color for the SplitFlap and the text color. If you 
select shaded=true, the given background and text color will be shaded a little bit for
the upper and lower part of the control.
